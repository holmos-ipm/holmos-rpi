# Holmos - Code

Holmos is a digital holographic microscope developed at [Fraunhofer IPM](http://ipm.fraunhofer.de) with help from local schools via the [Freiburg Seminar](https://freiburg-seminar.de) and with kind support from the [BMBF](https://www.bmbf.de).

The hardware is based on the Raspberry Pi.
This repository contains the code running on the Raspberry Pi to evaluate the camera images and calculate phase maps.
The [hardware repository](https://github.com/holmos-ipm/holmos-hardware/) contains instructions to build your own copy of the setup, and files describing the 3D-printed parts.

## Installation
Please see the separate [installation instructions](INSTALL.md) to get the software running on your Raspberry Pi.

## Project Status
Code and hardware are functional: several people have built copies in Freiburg.
However, there are probably still gaps in the documentation - if you stumble upon one, feel free to contact us.
You can open an issue here, or email us.
(Or improve the instructions yourself and request a merge...)

Please let us know if you attempt to build your own setup - we'd be very excited to hear from you!

## Contact
You can mail [Tobias](mailto:tobias.beckmann@ipm.fraunhofer.de) and [Alex](mailto:alexander.bertz@ipm.fraunhofer.de) with questions, comments - or just a short note if you've managed to build a working Holmos setup.

## License
The code in both repostiories is published under the GPLv3, see the [license](license.md).
